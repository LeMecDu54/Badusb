# Update-apps 2 and 3

## Differences

This script opens powershell as admin and updates app using **_winget upgrade --all_**

Version 2 will do the same as version 1, but it will have more prompting and is more user-friendly

Version 2 removes winget-created desktop shortcuts

Version 3 requires github servers being up, no code is shown 

Best: **v3**
